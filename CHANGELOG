v1.0.0.beta.11
  -- bug fix: you can now update the original image by simply calling "load_original" or "load_original_from_file" again

  -- new feature: url transformations. Read about it here: https://www.relishapp.com/moonmaster9000/couch-photo/docs/advanced-features/url-transformation

v1.0.0.beta.9
  -- fixing bugs in accessing the original via `document.original` and `document.variations["original.jpg"]`

v1.0.0.beta.8
  -- new variation metadata methods:
    - "variation_name": retrieve a variation's name via the "variation_name" method. e.g.: document.variations[:thumbnail].variation_name #==> "thumbnail"
    - "variation_filename": retrieve a variation's filename via the "variation_filename" method. e.g.: document.variations[:thumbnail].variation_filename #==> "thumbnail.jpg"
    - "attachment_name": retrieve a variation's attachment path via the "attachment_name" method. e.g.: documen.variations[:thumbnail].attachment_name #==> "variations/thumbnail.jpg"
